# Submission for 10Fold

# How to set up

## Backend: "node server.js"

## Frontend: "npm run dev"

## Brief Overiew

The site functions similarly to the provided Figma files, but I instead decided to have each video appear as a card rather than its own page. I always prefer to just focus on the video I am watching. With this implementation, users can watch the video they want, and simply come back out to all videos submitted (by a specific user).

There is a search feature that is character based, as well as an upload feature that takes in all required information outlined in the API documentation.

For the theme, I tried to keep it as clean as possible, leveraging teal as the secondary color to match the provided logo.
